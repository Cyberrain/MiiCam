It's only 5 questions, and if they're not relevant you can skip them, but please describe as much as possible to make it easy for me to understand what is going on.


**Do you use the command line, MQTT or the web interface?**
...


**What are you trying to do? What is the expected result?**
...


**What is the behaviour you experience? Can you describe what is going wrong?**
...


**Do you see any errors? If so, please copy paste the error message, or add a zip or tarbal containing the log files. Use back-ticks to make it readable please :)**
...


**How can I reproduce the error?**
