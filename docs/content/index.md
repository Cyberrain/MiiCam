# Welcome

You are reading the documentation for the MiiCam project.

The MiiCam project is a firmware hack for the Xiaomi Chuangmi IP Camera, a low budget ip camera which can be ordered online for around 12 to 15 dollar each.

It provides several additional software utilities that extend the functionality of this ip cam. Without this hack the camera is limited to usage through the MiiHome app, a cloud based viewer that only works well in mainland China.

By copying and unpacking the firmware to an SD card, it provides web based management, a local RTSP stream, motion detection, snapshot image creation, video recording functionality and more....


For common issues and known bugs, have a look [at the troubleshooting guide](/Troubleshooting)


!!! note "Don't forget to read the security considerations!"
    Make sure you read the [security consideration](/Security-Considerations) before installing the hack!
