# License stuff

## License

If I somehow screwed up in licensing a script or tool that I've copied from your project, let me know, so I can add the requested changes. (I really suck at licensing, but I'd like to do it right)

## Open Source

Sadly, not all software in this repository is open source: Although I try to use open source as much as possible, 
the `librtsp` and `gmlib` software that is intensively used in the rtsp daemon, are part of 
the grain media / faraday-tech toolchain and precompiled.

If you happen to know where to find the source code, please let me know :)
