# Helper utils

I've created some helper utils in `tools/dev/helpers.sh` that are useful when devving in the container.
It makes recompiling an uploading binaries to the camera a bit easier until I've build an update mechanism.

To use the dev helpers, open the file and change the `CAMERA_HOSTNAME` variable to the hostname or ip of your camera.
