# Development


## Warning to start with

**Many files on the Chuangmi 720P are writable. Be very careful when you modify files on it, you might brick it forever.**

Although the hack should be fully reversible by removing the SD card from the camera's slot, it's very easy to screw things up on this camera and create a very shiny paperweight object that doesn't do camera-ing anymore.

I'll test every change on my own Chuangmi cams, but I cannot guarantee that it keeps running smoothly if you change files that are not on the SD card.

Always use the releases rather than the latest master or development branches if you want to be sure of a more or less tested setup ;)


## Development on the camera

To get to know the hardware have a look at the documentation in the [toolchain](https://fliphess.com/toolchain/).

This is where you can find hardware specs and some minor documentation about the inner workings of some components and moving software parts like gmlib.

Feel free to ask questions, I'm not an expert, but I've read most of the pdf's multiple times and went through many loops to get to know how the mostly in chinese documented software libraries work.
