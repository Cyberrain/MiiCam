# Nightly Builds

For lazy people (like me), who sometimes forget to start a new build before going to sleep,
Every night a build is done and if it succeeds the content is uploaded to anaconda.

You can download the nightly builds for the firmware [from anaconda](https://anaconda.org/MiiCam/miicam-nightly/files)


## Quality 

As the nightly builds are created from master without the test routine I use for verifying new releases, 
I cannot guarantee these builds work as expected. 

I use the builds for testing purposes and upload the results to a package storage. 


Use them at your own risk and only if you know what you are doing!
