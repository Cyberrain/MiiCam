# MiiCam hack project

This projects provides an alternate firmware for the Xiaomi Chuangmi 720p IP Camera's.
These camera's, based on the Grain Media GM8136S SOC, normally only work using the cloudbased app.
With this firmware an alternate method of using this webcam is created that does not require an internet uplink.

**Please read the [security considerations in the documentation](https://miicam.github.io/Security-Considerations).**

## Following this repository

As I'm an chaotic idiot that talks to himself a lot, I recommend not to watch this repository, as you will receive lots of very useless notifications.
Choose the "Releases Only" flag to make yourself more zen :)
